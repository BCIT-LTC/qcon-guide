# Details about Ordered Lists

!!! note

    - questions should use numerics (e.g.: `1.`, `1)`)
    - answers that need an ordered list should use a letter (e.g.: `a.`, `a)`)
    - the list delimiter should be either a dot (`.`) or a closing parenthesis (`)`)
    - ordered lists that are part of the question should NOT use numerics for now (work in progress)
