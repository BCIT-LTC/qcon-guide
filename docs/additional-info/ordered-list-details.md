# Details about Ordered Lists

!!! note

    - Questions should be using numerics (e.g.: `1.`, `1)`)
    - Answers that needed an ordered list should be using a letter (e.g.: `a.`, `a)`)
    - The list delimiter should be either a dot (`.`) or a closing parenthesis (`)`)
    - Ordered list that is part of the question should NOT be using numerics for now (work in progress)
