# Using an *Answer Key* at the end of the file

!!! note inline end "*Inline* vs. *answer key* comparison"

    * Specifying answers *inline* makes it easy to verify the correct answer
    * An *answer key* makes it easy to print or distribute a valid assessment; the answer key does not need to be included

If you prefer specifying answers at the end of the file follow these simple formatting rules.

- The first heading in your document will be used as the section name in your question library.
- All questions should be numbered in sequence.
- Questions should *begin with a number* followed by either a period (**.**) or a right parenthesis (**)**), a space, and then the question text.
- Use the Word *Numbering* list style for best results.
- Indicate your correct answers with an asterisk or in an answer key section at the end of the document.
- Use ordered lists for the answer options.
- Start each answer option with a letter, then a period (**.**) or a right parenthesis (**)**), a space, and then the answer text.
- Comments, subheadings, footers, and headers will be ignored.

!!! note "*Answer Key*"

    At the end of the document, type "**Answers:**" on a separate line. Include all of the answers in a corresponding numerically ordered list.
