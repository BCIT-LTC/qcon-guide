## Errors during the process

There are three main categories of errors that can occur during conversion 

1. **Word document errors**
1. **Question formatting errors** [(example)](./assets/demo_process/canadian-holidays-quiz_question_format.docx) 
1. **System errors**.

The first pass over the document is to check for **Word document errors**. If any are found, the conversion process will stop and you will be notified of the errors. You will need to correct the errors in your Word document and re-upload it to Qcon.

If no **Word document errors** are found, the conversion process will continue to the question formatting check. If any **Question formatting errors** are found, the conversion process will stop and you will be notified of the errors. You will need to correct the errors in your Word document and re-upload it to Qcon.
