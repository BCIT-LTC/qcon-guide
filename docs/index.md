# Getting Started

Before using Qcon, youâ€™ll need to follow some simple formatting rules in your Word document. This User Guide will show you how. 

You can include your answers with the questions (inline) or altogether at the end of the document. 

## General Notes to Get You Started
* All questions in the document must begin with a number, followed by either a period (.) or a right parenthesis ()), a space, and then the question text.
* All questions in the document must be numbered in sequence. 
* Use ordered lists for the answer options. Ordered lists should be either lower-case or upper-case alpha.
* Similar to the question text, start each answer option with a letter, then a period (.) or a right parenthesis ()), a space, and then the answer text.
* Indicate the correct answer(s) by placing an asterisk (*) right before the answer text.
* Subheadings, footers, and headers will be ignored.
* The first heading in your document will be used as the folder name in the Learning Hub Question Library. If there is no level 1 heading then the file name of the Word document will be used instead. 

## Media

### Image

Images can be added to the question as long as it is in line with the text. To make the image inline with the text, you can:
   * right click on the image
   * Click on "Wrap Text"
   * Click on "In Line with Text"

If your image move position after doing the steps above, that means the image was on a different styling before. Just move the image to where you want it once the steps above is done.


### Video
