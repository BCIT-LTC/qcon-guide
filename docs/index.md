# Getting Started

Before using Qcon, youâ€™ll need to follow some simple formatting rules in your Word document. This User Guide will show you how. 

You can include your answers with the questions (inline) or altogether at the end of the document. 

### General Notes to Get You Started
* All questions in the document must begin with a number, followed by either a period (.) or a right parenthesis ()), a space, and then the question text.
* All questions in the document must be numbered in sequence. 
* Use ordered lists for the answer options. Ordered lists should be either lower-case or upper-case alpha.
* Similar to the question text, start each answer option with a letter, then a period (.) or a right parenthesis ()), a space, and then the answer text.
* Indicate the correct answer(s) by placing an asterisk (*) right before the answer text.
* Subheadings, footers, and headers will be ignored.
* The first heading in your document will be used as the folder name in the Learning Hub Question Library. If there is no level 1 heading then the file name of the Word document will be used instead.
